_From quasars to cosmic voids: new probes of dark energy with extreme cosmic structures_ - in the context of the _Lendület_ excellence program, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences ([HAS](https://mta.hu/english)) selected this research project for funding. See further details at the web page of the Eötvös Loránd Research Network ([ELKH](https://elkh.org/en/news/eight-new-elkh-research-groups-win-grant-to-start-work-as-part-of-the-2022-mta-lendulet-momentum-program/)).

The main goal of this 5-year project is to extend the mapping of the largest _cosmic voids_ and _superclusters_ to un-probed, key redshift ranges (z>1). Then, the _Lendület-LSS_ team will cross-correlate the positions of these super-structures with Cosmic Microwave Backgound (CMB) anisotropies to learn about the cosmic dark sector, and about the growth of density fluctuations in such extreme corners of the Universe.
