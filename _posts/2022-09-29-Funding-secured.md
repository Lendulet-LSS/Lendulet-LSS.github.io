The Hungarian Academy of Sciences ([HAS](https://mta.hu/english)) selected the _From quasars to cosmic voids: new probes of dark energy with extreme cosmic structures_ project for funding in the context of the _Lendület_ excellence program. See further details at the web page of the Eötvös Loránd Research Network ([ELKH](https://elkh.org/en/news/eight-new-elkh-research-groups-win-grant-to-start-work-as-part-of-the-2022-mta-lendulet-momentum-program/)).

The main goal of this 5-year project is to extend the mapping of the largest _cosmic voids_ and _superclusters_ to un-probed, key redshift ranges (z>1). Then, the Lendület-LSS team will cross-correlate the positions of these super-structures with Cosmic Microwave Backgound (CMB) anistropies to learn about the cosmic dark sector, and about the growth of density fluctuations in such extreme patches of the Universe.
