The Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) selected the _From quasars to cosmic voids: new probes of dark energy with extreme cosmic structures_ project for funding in the context of the _Lendület_ excellence program. 

The main goal of this 5-year project is to extend the mapping of the largest cosmic voids and superclusters un-prebed, key redshift ranges. Then, the team will cross-correlate the positions of these super-structures with Cosmic Microwave Backgound (CMB) anistropies to learn about the cosmic dark sector.
