The [Konkoly Observatory](https://konkoly.hu/index.shtml) of the [Research Centre for Astronomy and Earth Sciences](https://csfk.org/en/) (Budapest, Hungary) invites applications for two **PhD student positions in observational cosmology**, as part of the newly formed _Lendület_ large-scale structure research group led by _Dr. András Kovács_. The group’s main objectives include cosmic web analyses of state-of-the-art galaxy and quasar survey data sets, and their cross-correlations with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy maps. 

Candidates with a masters degree in astronomy, astrophysics, or physics, and experience in either of these fields are encouraged to apply. The appointments are **available for 4 years from September 2023** (later starting dates are possible). The place of the doctoral studies will be the Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) in Budapest where the applications are processed, while the research itself will be carried out at Konkoly Observatory. The projects will be co-supervised by Dr. István Csabai (ELTE) and we expect to involve the student in the international network of our collaborating research groups.

The PhD students will participate in the simulated analysis and early exploration of observational data from multiple ongoing and upcoming galaxy/QSO surveys, based on the institute’s membership in the _Legacy Survey of Space and Time_ (LSST) project at the _Vera C. Rubin Observatory_ and the _WEAVE-QSO_ survey. Funded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the main objective of the group is to extend the mapping and cosmological analysis of cosmic voids and superclusters to un-probed, key redshift ranges, and study the growth of structure in such extreme cosmic environments. 

The host is Hungary's largest astronomical institute, located in a newly renovated building in a natural reserve area 30 minutes from the city center. The observatory has been dynamically expanding in recent years, including two ERC-funded projects, Hungarian excellence grants (_Lendület, Élvonal_), ESA projects, and several international staff members. Konkoly Observatory recognises the importance and benefit of a diverse and inclusive working climate, which ultimately leads to further advancements in science, equity and social justice. Therefore, we welcome applications from candidates without regard to their national origin, race, gender identity and religion.

Applications should be submitted via the webpage of the [ELTE Doctoral School of Physics](https://apply.elte.hu/courses/course/206-phd-doctoral-school-physics) until 31 May.  Further information is available at the website of the [Hungarian Doctoral Council](https://doktori.hu/index.php?menuid=195&lang=EN&tk_ID=238285), while for informal enquiries please contact _Dr. András Kovács_ and visit the website of [Konkoly Observatory](https://konkoly.hu/index.shtml).
