The Konkoly Observatory of the Research Centre for Astronomy and Earth Sciences (Budapest, Hungary) invites applications for a postdoctoral position in observational cosmology, as part of the newly formed Lendület large-scale structure research group led by Dr. András Kovács. The group’s main objectives include cosmic web analyses of state-of-the-art galaxy and quasar survey data sets, and their cross-correlations with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy maps. Candidates with a PhD in astronomy, astrophysics, or physics, and experience in either of these fields are encouraged to apply. The appointment is available for 2 years from February 2023 (later starting dates are possible), with the possibility of a 2 year extension in the context of the Lendület funding, or from annually advertised Hungarian postdoctoral fellowship calls.

The postdoctoral fellow will participate in the simulated analysis and early exploration of observational data from multiple ongoing and upcoming galaxy/QSO surveys, based on the group’s membership in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) project at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Euclid Consortium, the J-PAS project, the WEAVE-QSO survey, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Funded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the main objective of the group is to extend the mapping and cosmological analysis of cosmic voids and superclusters to un-probed, key redshift ranges, and study the growth of structure in such extreme cosmic environments. 

The host is Hungary's largest astronomical institute, located in a newly renovated building in a natural reserve area 30 minutes from the city center. The observatory has been dynamically expanding in recent years, including two ERC-funded projects, Hungarian excellence grants (Lendület, Élvonal), ESA projects, and several international staff members. Konkoly Observatory recognises the importance and benefit of a diverse and inclusive working climate, which ultimately leads to further advancements in science, equity and social justice. Therefore, we welcome applications from candidates without regard to their national origin, race, gender identity and religion.

Applications should be submitted to Dr. András Kovács via email (kovacs.andras@csfk.org), and they should include a single PDF file that contains a short cover letter, a CV, a 2-page statement of research interests and plans, and a list of publications. Complete applications should be received by the 1st of December 2022 for full consideration. Applicants should also arrange for 3 reference letters to be sent by the above date. For further information and informal enquiries please contact Dr. András Kovács and visit the website of Konkoly Observatory (https://konkoly.hu/).
