## Researcher goals and methods

The standard Î›CDM (Lambda-Cold Dark Matter) cosmological model has emerged as the consensus model of Einstein's generally relativistic universe. It has shown truly remarkable explanatory power over a variety of cosmic scales and epochs, and it narrates a reassuring story of a model universe currently filled mostly with dark matter and dark energy. However, this explanation is not _completely_ satisfactory because the actual nature of the dark sector remains a key puzzle.

To address this problem, international collaborations have built new instruments to map ever larger cosmological volumes. The PI has led data-analysis projects in state-of-the-art galaxy and quasar surveys (DES, Euclid, eBOSS), with a pioneering role in precise measurements and simulations of the [integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachs%E2%80%93Wolfe_effect) (ISW) effect. 

In particular, the group will focus on mapping the largest under-dense structures in the cosmic web, the _cosmic voids_, that have been widely used for CMB-LSS cross-correlation studies. Related results in observational cosmology have generated considerable media attention including a cover of the [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-emptiest-place-in-space/) and a [Fermilab](https://news.fnal.gov/2022/01/scientists-move-a-step-closer-to-understanding-the-cold-spot-in-the-cosmic-microwave-background/) press release.
