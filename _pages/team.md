### Dr. András Kovács (PI)
Coordinator of the _Lendület-LSS_ project, supervisor of students.

### Postdoctoral fellow (open position)
Starting from February 2023 (later dates are possible), the postdoc fellow will be involved in simulated and real-world analysis of large data sets of the cosmic web, including cross-correlations with CMB anisotropies.

# PhD students
### Nestor Arsenov (part-time, IA Sofia)
Supported by a fellowship from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Erasmus+ grants, Nestor is a visiting doctoral student who develops halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for QSO and galaxy surveys (Gaia, J-PAS, Pan-STARRS, DES), and contributes to measurements of correlations between void positions and secondary CMB anisotropies (ISW, lensing, tSZ).

### Mar Pérez Sar (part-time, IAC Tenerife)
 at un-probed, key redshift ranges (z>1)

### PhD Student (open position, full-time)
Starting from September 2023, the student will work on statistical analyses of QSO data, galaxy catalogs, and the high-z Lyman-alpha forest. The main goal of the thesis work will be to explore the prospects of CMB-LSS cross-correlations using state-of-the-art surveys (LSST-DESC, Euclid).
