### Dr. András Kovács (PI)
Coordinator of the _Lendület-LSS_ project, supervisor of students.

### Postdoctoral fellow (open position)
Starting from February 2023 (later dates are possible), the postdoc fellow will be involved in the simulated and real-world analyses of large data sets of the cosmic web, including cross-correlations with CMB anisotropies using galaxies, QSOs, and the Lyman-alpha forest.

# PhD students
### Nestor Arsenov (part-time)
Supported by a fellowship from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Erasmus+ grants, Nestor is a visiting doctoral student who develops halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for QSO and galaxy surveys (Gaia, J-PAS, Pan-STARRS, DES), contributes to measurements of correlations between void positions and secondary CMB anisotropies (ISW, lensing, tSZ), and explores machine learning solutions to estimate accurate photometric redshifts for J-PAS QSOs.

### Mar Pérez Sar (part-time)
 at un-probed, key redshift ranges (z>1)

### PhD Student (open position)
Starting from September 2023, the student will work on statistical analyses of recent QSO data sets, galaxy catalogs, and the high-z Lyman-alpha forest fluctuations. The main goal of the thesis work (2023-2027) will be to explore the prospects of CMB-LSS cross-correlations using state-of-the-art galaxy surveys (LSST-DESC, Euclid), participate in survey validation efforts, and then extract cosmological information.

# Master students
### Gisela Camacho (part-time)
In the context of forecast analyses of _Void x CMB_ cross-correlation signals, Gisela's work contributes to the group's efforts to exploit the rich QSO catalogs froom upcoming J-PAS survey, and thus extend the range of lensing measurements to higher redshifts (z>1).

### Christine Lee (part-time)
The main goal of Christine's project is to use z<1 galaxy catalogs, extracted from a combination of Pan-STARRS and WISE data, for measuring the CMB lensing signal of voids defined by the ZOBOV method. These results might be extended to other survey data sets in the context of the _Lendület-LSS_ project (LSST-DESC, Euclid).
