### Dr. András Kovács (PI)
Coordinator of the _Lendület-LSS_ project, supervisor of students.

### Postdoctoral fellow (open position)
Starting from February 2023 (later dates are possible), the postdoc fellow will be involved in the simulated and real-world analyses of large data sets of the cosmic web, including cross-correlations with CMB anisotropies using galaxies, QSOs, and the Lyman-alpha forest.

# PhD students
### Nestor Arsenov (part-time)
Supported by a fellowship from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Erasmus+ grants, Nestor is a visiting doctoral student who develops halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for QSO and galaxy surveys (Gaia, J-PAS, Pan-STARRS, DES), contributes to measurements of correlations between void positions and secondary CMB anisotropies (ISW, lensing, tSZ), and explores machine learning solutions to estimate accurate photometric redshifts for J-PAS QSOs.

### Mar Pérez Sar (part-time)
 at un-probed, key redshift ranges (z>1)

### PhD Student (open position)
Starting from September 2023, the student will work on statistical analyses of recent QSO data sets, galaxy catalogs, and the high-z Lyman-alpha forest fluctuations. The main goal of the thesis work (2023-2027) will be to explore the prospects of CMB-LSS cross-correlations using state-of-the-art surveys (LSST-DESC, Euclid), particippate in survey validation efforts, and then extract cosmological information.

# Master students
### Gisela Camacho (part-time)
In the context forecast analyses of _Void x CMB_ cross-correlation signals, Gisela's work contributes to the group's efforts to exploit the rich QSO catalogs froom upcoming J-PAS survey, and thus extend the range of lensing measurements to higher redshifts (z>1).

### Christine Lee (part-time)
Participating in forecast analyses

### Erik Gebhard (full-time)
